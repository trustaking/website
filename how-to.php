            <h2>What is cold staking?</h2>
            <p>Staking coins strengthens the network and you get rewarded for finding blocks. Cold staking is a safer way to stake your coins.<br>
            Cold Staking allows you to safely store the coins in your wallet while a separate always online cold staking wallet stakes the coins, meaning you don't have to keep your wallet open for staking.<br>
            The cold staking wallet has no access to your coins and you can withdraw coins your Cold Balance to any address at any time.</p>
