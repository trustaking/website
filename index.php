				<h2>Cold Staking</h2>
				<p>Cold Staking lets users securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes” which contain no coins. The purpose of these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to a blockchain network and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to spend its coins. In other words, it allows users to stake offline coins.</p>

				<h2>Benefits of staking</h2>
				<p>Staking enables coin holders to earn compounding rewards in return for freezing their staked coins so they cannot be otherwise used while they are being staked. Stack those coins!</p>

				<h2>Withdraw at anytime<br />
				No Penalties</h2>
				<p>Staked Coins aren't kept on the full node, so you and only you can withdraw your coins back to your wallet at anytime. No fee's or penalties.</p>
